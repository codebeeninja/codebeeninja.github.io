We saw many students learning programming and after learning a language, they will not be able to write a code for a single problem on their own. The problem is not with the student, it is with the approach they have used to learn the language. 

Besides, there is a difference between learning a programming language and learning programming. !! The aforementioned students are the former whereas at Code Bee we teach the later (Programming along with programming language).

We will teach you the problem solving techniques which will lay as a foundation to learn and master any programming language with competitiveness on your own.

From recorded videos, live training, office hours, integrated assignments, weekly quizzes to many more all in a single platform available to you to have an excellent learning experience.

Our 1:1 personal sessions include customised curriculum suiting the need of the student to start from where they are at in the journey of learning programming.

From 6th Grade to graduates to professionals, we train different age group of students & professionals in programming.
